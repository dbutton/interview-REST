# interview-REST

REST service to accept email address, store them with a timestamp, and report the list of email addresses and timestamps.

REQUIREMENTS:

This REST web service service should have two endpoints:

·        /register that accepts a POST that stores an email address delivered as JSON

·        /reglist that returns a JSON list of the email addresses registered, together with the time they were registered.


The code for this application should be placed in an online Git-based SCM repository - e.g. GitLab, GitHub, BitBucket.


After you have demonstrated the application, we will ask you to change the code in the repository to accept a different endpoint name for the /reglist response. This change should trigger a very basic CI/CD for this web service.


You may build both the web service and the CI/CD pipeline with any of the technologies or services you wish.
